Introductory logic-building solutions to popular coding problems, written in C as part of DSA coursework.
# Logic Building Practice in C

This repository contains my solutions to a set of logic-focused programming problems assigned during my Data Structures and Algorithms coursework.

The aim of these implementations is to strengthen core thinking and problem-solving ability rather than provide the most optimized or interview-ready answers.

Many of the problem statements are inspired by well-known coding practice platforms.

## Purpose of This Repository

- Practice translating problem statements into working code  
- Improve clarity of logic and control flow  
- Build confidence in implementing solutions from scratch  
- Maintain a record of my learning progress

## Language Used

C

## Nature of the Solutions

These programs prioritize readability and understanding.

They may not always use the most optimal approaches, advanced data structures, or best possible time/space complexities.

## Problems Included

1. Write a program that accepts the user's first and last name and prints them in reverse order with a space between them.

2. Write a program that will accept the base and height of a triangle from user and compute its area.

3. Write a program to swap two given numbers without using a temporary variable.

4. Write a program to check if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.  
Note:  
An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.  
A scalene triangle has three unequal sides.  
An isosceles triangle is a triangle with (at least) two equal sides.

5. Write a program to check whether any given year is a Leap year or not.

6. Write a program to find the mean, mode, and median of a list of values.

7. Write a program to count the number of strings in a given list of strings. The string length is 2 or more, and the first and last characters are the same.

8. Write a program to print the numbers of a specified list after removing even numbers from it.

9. Write a recursive function that checks whether a passed string is a palindrome or not.  
Note: A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.

10. Write a function that takes a number as a parameter and checks whether the number is prime or not.  
Note: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 and has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

11. Write a function that accepts a string and counts the number of upper- and lower-case letters.

12. Write a function that will take an input n, and will print the numbers from 1 to n, replacing multiples of 3 with “Fizz”, multiples of 5 with “Buzz”, and multiples of 3 and 5 with “FizzBuzz”.

13. Write a function to find the longest word in a given sentence.

14. Write a function that will take a sentence as input and will count how many times each character appears.

15. Write a function that will find the longest prefix of a string that is also a suffix of the same string.

16. Write a function to find the longest palindromic substring.

17. Write a function to reverse each word of a sentence.  
Sample: "Hello World" → "olleH dlroW"

18. Write a function to convert time format.  
Sample: Convert "14:35" → "02:35 PM" and vice versa.

## How to Compile and Run

Use GCC to compile:

gcc filename.c -o output

Run:

./output

## Academic Context

These problems were provided by the course instructor as exercises to develop logical thinking and coding discipline.
